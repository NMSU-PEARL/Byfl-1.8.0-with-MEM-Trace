=head1 NAME

bfbin2hdf5 - convert Byfl output to an HDF5 data file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<bfbin2hdf5> I<input_file.byfl> [I<output_file.h5>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

By default, applications instrumented with Byfl write measurement data
to a binary F<.byfl> file.  B<bfbin2hdf5> converts such files to HDF5
data files.  These can be viewed with the
L<HDFView|http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/> GUI or
processed with various command-line tools.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<bfbin2hdf5> has no command-line options.  The program accepts the
name of a F<.byfl> file to read and a HDF5 data file to create.  If
not specified, the name of the data file will be the same as that of
the input file but with F<.byfl> replaced with F<.h5>.  (If the file
name does not end in F<.byfl> then F<.h5> will be appended to the file
name.)

=head1 EXAMPLES

The simplest usage is just

    $ bfbin2hdf5 myprog.byfl

which produces F<myprog.h5>.

If the F<.byfl> file is expected to be used only to produce the HDF5
data file and then deleted, one can save time and disk space by
writing Byfl binary output to a named pipe and running B<bfbin2hdf5>
on that named pipe:

    $ mkfifo myprog.pipe
    $ bfbin2hdf5 myprog.pipe myprog.h5 &
    $ env BF_BINOUT=myprog.pipe ./myprog
    $ rm myprog.pipe
